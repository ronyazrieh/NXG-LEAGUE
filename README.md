# Welcome to NXG-League
### In Development

## What is NXG LEaGUE…
NXG League is a web application that utilizes Meta’s React front-end framework for a community drop-in football league located in Ottawa. This website is in development for a future local league.

The use of React in this web-application was to take advantage of the “functional programming” that allows the use of components. This allows me to create a much more dynamic and modular website for the user.

NXG League will allow users to sign up for a team, and view their team stats amongst other team and players. This project was built from the ground up by me, which includes the graphic design process. Adobe XD was used to create the high-fidelity mockup.




## What next
Since NXG League is still in development there is much time until it’s completion. The hope is to fully finish the front-end of the website. Future plans are to incorporate Django to create the database similar the Limitless project.
